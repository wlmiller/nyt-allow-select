# NYT Allow Text Selection

The New York Times website has JavaScript on its articles which prevent the user from selecting text, for example to copy it.
This is a simple Chrome extension which removes that restriction, so that text can be selected.

It's available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nyt-allow-text-selection/cbpfaiooggphdooecgnanonppaonbjhg).
